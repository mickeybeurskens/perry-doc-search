# ðŸ•µ Perry AI Powered Document Analysis
Perry - AI Powered Document Analysis.
Perry allows you to upload PDF documents for question answering and information search.
The project contains a fully functioning backend with authentication built in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), with document search built using [LLamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index). 
The frontend has been built using [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit), and deployment is done through Docker.

## Features
You can upload documents, choose an agent to answer questions, and ask questions about the document. The agents are powered by OpenAI's API. Currently there is an echo agent for testing and a sub question agent that decomposes questions into sub questions for each applicable document. It is possible to implement more agents by adding them to the `backend.perry.agents` module.

## Disclaimer
Everything is this repository has served as a proof of concept for a limited amount of users. You can use if for inspiration, but it is not production ready out of the box. Especially document uploads and session management will not scale with user demand.
